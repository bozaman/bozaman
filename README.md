Hello! 👋 My name is Joe (or more accurately, Joseph - but I really prefer Joe). I was born yesterday and eventually
grew up, attended a large university to learn many things and since then have worked for several companies,
doing stuff. 👨‍💻

This has led me to where I am now -- working for a company, doing stuff. 👨‍💻 In the time I'm not doing stuff, I like
to do other things and I may even share some of those other things here for everyone to see. I hope to keep doing
these and maybe even other things for a long time .... 😎

I currently do stuff and other things from my home in Phoenix, Arizona. That's in the Sonoran Desert 🌵 where it often
gets hot 🥵, usually in the summer which lasts most of the year. It's not as fun to do stuff or other things when it's
too hot, but you get used to it. Winters are usually pretty nice, though. It doesn't snow here in the winter (usually),
and we have palm trees. 🌴 So there's that. 👍

If you are reading this or otherwise visiting this little corner of the interwebs intentionally you may have some interest
in my stuff or other things, in which case: welcome! 🎉

If you found yourself here by accident ... well, in that case: welcome! 🍾

Either way, I'm glad you're here and thank you for taking a moment to look around, have fun, and maybe find something
that can help you doing stuff and other things. 🥳
