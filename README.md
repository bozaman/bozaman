hello! my name is joe (or more accurately, joseph but i really prefer joe).
i was born yesterday and eventually grew up, attended a large university to learn many things and since then have
worked for several companies doing stuff, which has led me to where i am now - working for a company doing stuff.
in the time i'm not doing stuff, i like to do other things and i may even share some of those other things here for
everyone to see. i hope to keep doing these and maybe even other things for a long time .... :)

i currently do stuff and other things in phoenix, arizona. that’s in the desert where it often gets hot, usually
in the summer which lasts most of the year. it’s not as fun to do stuff or other things when it’s too hot, but you
get used to it. winters are pretty nice, though. it doesn’t snow and we have palm trees. so there’s that.

if you are reading this or other visiting this blog you may have some interest in my stuff or other things, in which
case: welcome! if you found yourself here by accident … well, in that case: welcome! either way, thanks for finding
your way here. look around, have fun, and maybe find something that can help you doing stuff and other things.

joe
